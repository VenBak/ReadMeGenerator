# Read Me  File Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was try and make a command line interface application which allows you to create a high quality readme file with all of its components such as a license, badge, table of contents and embedded URLs. The motivation behind this project was for me to test my skills with node and its libraries such as the inquirer package from npm. The functionality of this project makes it so that you can quickly create a readme file without having to copy paste of the intricacies of the formatting. During the coding of this project I learned how to make use of node and npm. Learnt the object of questioning and how the data flows within the javascript file.
